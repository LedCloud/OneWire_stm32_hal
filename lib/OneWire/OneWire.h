 ********************* Description *************************
 * This library is based on the labrary taken from 
 * https://stm32f4-discovery.net/2015/07/hal-library-05-onewire-for-stm32fxxx/
 * Unlike that library this one doesn't use delays.
 * It use system UART to communicate with OneWire device(s).
 * 
 * UART must be set before calling this function
 * Settings of UART:
 * Asynchronous mode, global interrupt enabled.
 * Baud Rate - any, it will be reset in the reset function.
 * 8-n-1
 * Connection of RX & TX should be done as specified here 
 * https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/technical-documents/tutorials/2/214.html
 * or use a diod to connect RX and TX to 1Wire bus
 * +3.3V----+

 *          ÐŸ 4.7k Resistor
